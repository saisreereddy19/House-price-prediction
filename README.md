House Price Prediction Using Regression Models
Technologies: HTML5, CSS, Flask, Scikit-learn, Python

This project aims to predict house prices using regression models based on a dataset containing over 20,000 entries. The key steps of the project include:

Linear Regression Model: Implemented a Linear Regression model to predict house prices with an impressive accuracy rate of 85%. The model is trained on features such as area, number of bedrooms, and amenities.
User-Friendly Interface: Developed a simple yet effective web interface using Flask, allowing users to input essential details like area, number of bedrooms, and available amenities, and receive instant price predictions.
Data Visualization & Feature Selection: Leveraged data visualization techniques to analyze the dataset, ensuring proper feature selection and identifying the most influential factors that contribute to accurate price predictions.
This project demonstrates the application of machine learning, web development, and data science techniques to solve a real-world problem, providing an accessible platform for users to estimate house prices based on various features.
